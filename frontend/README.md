# Address Book Frontend

## Ideas

- We can have multiple different features with reusable componentes.
- Login page will need a controlled form with username, password, submit (inputs stored in state)
- Submit button sends a post request to the backend 
- Returns a token that we can use to authenticate the user

- Folder structure: Components folder, inside of which there is a folder for each component that would hold the jsx file and css (if we are using CSS - option to use tailwind?)
- Option to use Nextjs
